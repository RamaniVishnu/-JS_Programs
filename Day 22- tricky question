This JavaScript code snippet can be a bit tricky due to how JavaScript handles object keys. Let's break it down:

javascript
Copy code
var a = {},
    b = { key: 'b' },
    c = { key: 'c' };

a[b] = 123;
a[c] = 456;

console.log(a[b]);
output is 456.
explanation:
Three variables a, b, and c are declared using the var keyword.
Object b is initialized with a key key whose value is 'b'.
Object c is initialized with a key key whose value is 'c'.
Object a is initialized as an empty object {}.
a[b] = 123; sets the property of object a with key b (but not the object b itself) to 123.
a[c] = 456; sets the property of object a with key c (but not the object c itself) to 456.
Finally, console.log(a[b]); tries to access the property of object a with key b. However, since b and c are both objects, they are converted to strings when used as object keys. 
The default string representation of an object is "[object Object]". Therefore, a[b] is equivalent to a["[object Object]"], which is the same as a[c].
As a result, console.log(a[b]); outputs 456.
So, unexpectedly, a[b] and a[c] are treated as the same property of object a because they are converted to the same string key "[object Object]".
This behavior can be confusing and highlights the importance of understanding how JavaScript handles object keys and equality.
