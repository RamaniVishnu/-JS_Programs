Question:
1)what is the difference between these two ways 
a)let fruit=[]; 
fruit =['apple']; 
console.log(fruit);
b)let fruit=[];
fruit.push('apple'); 
console.log(fruit);

Answer:
Both code snippets achieve the same end result of creating an array containing the string 'apple',
but they differ in their approach and some subtle aspects:

Code Snippet A
let fruit = [];
fruit = ['apple'];
console.log(fruit);
i)Initialization and Reassignment: Initially, fruit is declared as an empty array [], but in the next line,
it is reassigned to a new array ['apple'].
ii)Creates a New Array: The line fruit = ['apple'] creates a new array and assigns it to the variable fruit,
replacing the initial empty array.

Code Snippet B
let fruit = [];
fruit.push('apple');
console.log(fruit);
i)Initialization and Mutation: Here, fruit is declared as an empty array [], and then the push method is used 
to add 'apple' to the existing array.
ii)Mutates the Existing Array: The push method modifies the original array by adding an element to it without
creating a new array.

Key Differences
i)Reassignment vs. Mutation:
In Snippet A, the original empty array is replaced with a new array containing ['apple'].
In Snippet B, the original empty array is directly modified by adding 'apple'.

ii)Performance:
Snippet A involves creating a new array, which can be slightly less efficient if repeated many times.
Snippet B directly modifies the existing array, which can be more efficient for large arrays or frequent modifications.

iii)Intended Use:
Snippet A is more suited if you want to completely replace the array with a new one.
Snippet B is more suited if you want to build or modify the existing array dynamically.

Summary
Both snippets produce the same output but employ different techniques to achieve it. Snippet A replaces the entire array,
while Snippet B modifies the existing array.
